# mvrpois
## This is an R package for working with the multivariate Poisson distribution (MVP) as defined in *Karlis 2005*. 

What you can do:
  *Generate samples from a MVP
  *Get the probability of a sample given its latent Poisson rates
  *Fit the parameters of a MVP for a given data set, either learning the latent rates or the regression coefficients using Gibbs sampling or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
